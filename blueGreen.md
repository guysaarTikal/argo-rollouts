* **maxUnavailable** - The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update. <br />
* **scaleDownDelaySeconds** - The ScaleDownDelaySeconds is used to delay scaling down the old ReplicaSet after the active Service is switched to the new ReplicaSet. <br />
* **autoPromotionEnabled** - The AutoPromotionEnabled will make the rollout automatically promote the new ReplicaSet to the active service once the new ReplicaSet is healthy. <br />
* **scaleDownDelayRevisionLimit** - The ScaleDownDelayRevisionLimit limits the number of old active ReplicaSets to keep scaled up while they wait for the scaleDownDelay to pass after being removed from the active service.
autoPromotionSeconds -The AutoPromotionSeconds will make the rollout automatically promote the new ReplicaSet to active Service after the AutoPromotionSeconds time has passed since the rollout has entered a paused state. If the AutoPromotionEnabled field is set to true, this field will be ignored. <br />
* **prePromotionAnalysis** - Configures the Analysis before it switches traffic to the new version. The AnalysisRun can be used to block the Service selector switch until the AnalysisRun finishes successful. The success or failure of the analysis run decides if the Rollout will switch traffic, or abort the Rollout completely. <br />
* **postPromotionAnalysis** - Configures the Analysis after the traffic switch to new version. If the analysis run fails or errors out, the Rollout enters an aborted state and switch traffic back to the previous stable Replicaset. If scaleDownDelaySeconds is specified, the controller will cancel any AnalysisRuns at time of scaleDownDelay to scale down the ReplicaSet. If it is omitted, and post analysis is specified, it will scale down the ReplicaSet only after the AnalysisRun completes (with a minimum of 30 seconds).<br />
* **previewReplicaCount** - The PreviewReplicaCount field will indicate the number of replicas that the new version of an application should run. Once the application is ready to promote to the active service, the controller will scale the new ReplicaSet to the value of the spec.replicas. The rollout will not switch over the active service to the new ReplicaSet until it matches the spec.replicas count
